I love open source, live in the terminal, and think agentic workflows are the future.

I'm chasing this idea I call **Kinetic Code**, code that doesn't just work, it moves. Engineering that dances with user experience, marketing, and a bit of fun.

I’m building **CodeMachine**, a new way to ship software where AI agents don’t just assist, they orchestrate development end-to-end.
